## Introduction

This is the report for the analysis on the [European Value Study (EVS) from 2017](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7500) which is a survey research program on how Europeans in `r params$country_char` think about family, work, religion, politics, and society. We are mainly interested in Europeans thoughts on two questions:

1. When a mother works for pay, do Europeans think the children suffer?
2. When jobs are scarce, do Europeans think employers should give priority to local people over immigrants?

```{r read in data}
library(haven)
EVS = read_sav("../EVS_shiny/data/EVS_data_cleaned.sav")
EVS_country = EVS[which(EVS$country == params$country_num),]
```

## Descriptives of variables

In the following table, the variables are:

1. `v72` represents the first question of interest (1-strongly agree, 2-agree, 3-disagree, or 4-strongly disagree)
2. `v80` represents the second question of interest (1-strongly agree, 2-agree, 3-neither agree nor disagree, 4-disagree, or 5-strongly disagree)
3. `sex` (1-male or 2-female)
4. `age` (years)
5. `education` (1-lower, 2-medium, or 3-higher)

```{r descriptives continuous}
library(memisc)
library(pander)

pander(summary(EVS_country[,-which(names(EVS_country)%in%c("country","sex","education"))]), 
       caption="Descriptive table for continuous variables")
```

```{r descriptives categorical}
library(insight)

cat_table = table(EVS_country$education, EVS_country$sex, dnn = c("Education","Sex"))
rownames(cat_table) = c("Lower","Medium","Higher")
colnames(cat_table) = c("M","F")

export_table(format_table(cat_table), format = "md", 
             caption = "Descriptive table for categorical variables")
```


## Graphs

```{r plot_v72, fig.cap="Boxplot for first question of interest (v72)", out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(EVS_country, aes(as.factor(v72), age)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "When a mother works for pay, the children suffer", y = "Age (Years)") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("strongly agree", "agree", "disagree", "strongly disagree"))
```

```{r plot_v80, fig.cap="Boxplot for second question of interest (v80)", out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
ggplot(EVS_country, aes(as.factor(v80), age)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "When jobs are scarce, give priority to local people over immigrants", 
       y = "Age (Years)") + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("strongly agree", "agree", "neither agree nor disagree", 
                              "disagree", "strongly disagree"))
```

## Regression Analysis

### Model: v72 ~ age + $\sqrt{\text{age}}$ + sex + education

```{r factorize}
EVS_country$sex = factor(EVS_country$sex, levels=c(1,2), labels=c("-male","-female"))
EVS_country$education = factor(EVS_country$education, levels=c(1,2,3), labels=c("-lower","-medium","-higher"))
```

```{r global library, echo=FALSE}
library(stringr)
```

```{r summary_v72}
model_v72 = lm(v72 ~ age + sqrt(age) + sex + education, data = EVS_country)
pander(summary(model_v72))
```

The coefficient estimate for `sex` is `r (v72_sex_est = model_v72$coefficients[which(str_detect(names(model_v72$coefficients),"sex"))])` which means that the effect of a female respondent compared to a male is `r if(v72_sex_est>0){"positive"}else{"negative"}`. The corresponding $p$-value is `r (v72_sex_p = summary(model_v72)$coefficients[which(str_detect(names(model_v72$coefficients),"sex")),4])` which is `r if(v72_sex_p<0.05){"smaller than 0.05"}else{"greater than or equal to 0.05"}`. Thus, `sex` is `r if(v72_sex_p<0.05){"significant in the model"}else{"not significant in the model"}`.

### Model: v80 ~ age + $\sqrt{\text{age}}$ + sex + education

```{r summary_v80}
model_v80 = lm(v80 ~ age + sqrt(age) + sex + education, data = EVS_country)
pander(summary(model_v80))
```

The coefficient estimate for `sex` is `r (v80_sex_est = model_v80$coefficients[which(str_detect(names(model_v80$coefficients),"sex"))])` which means that the effect of a female respondent compared to a male is `r if(v80_sex_est>0){"positive"}else{"negative"}`. The corresponding $p$-value is `r (v80_sex_p = summary(model_v80)$coefficients[which(str_detect(names(model_v80$coefficients),"sex")),4])` which is `r if(v80_sex_p<0.05){"smaller than 0.05"}else{"greater than or equal to 0.05"}`. Thus, `sex` is `r if(v80_sex_p<0.05){"significant in the model"}else{"not significant in the model"}`.
